**Unit 4: Paradiso** <span id="4"></span> 
*We will conclude the course with the final section of* The Divine
Comedy*, in which Beatrice guides the poet through spheres of heaven,
each of which is associated with levels of the angelic hierarchy.  As we
read, we will continue to think about the text within the context of
Medieval knowledge, science, and cosmology.  We will consider Dante’s
construction of his world through references to the planets, as well as
his explicit interest in Beatrice as a muse.  As we conclude our study
of* The Divine Comedy*, we will also consider the effect of the text as
a whole.  We will think critically about Dante’s classification of his
poem as a “Divine Comedy” in conjunction with the conclusion and address
other questions of genre.*

     Instructions: From Dante’s *De Monarchia*, please read the

    rule.  
        
     Note on the text: In *De Monarchia*, Dante takes a controversial
    stance on the conflict between secular authority and religious
    authority.  
     In the essay, he argues against the theocratic rule established in
    the *Unum Sanctum*.  Dante contends that the role of secular
    authorities is quite different from that of religious authorities;
    while it is an emperor’s duty to help men reach a peaceful, earthly
    paradise, it is the pope’s duty to lead men towards eternal
    paradise.

    Inferno* and *The Purgatorio*.  At the same time, he emphasizes the
    historical accuracy of *The Divine Comedy*, arguing that his
    allegory in founded in literal truth.
