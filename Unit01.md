**Unit 1: Dante** <span id="1"></span> 
*We will start the course by taking a close look at Dante’s personal
life.  In this unit, we will learn about the influences—political,
religious, and literary—that came to shape his career.  Because his
works were undoubtedly influenced by his personal life, we will also
learn about his relationship with his love and muse Beatrice, whom many
scholars consider worthy of study in her own right.  This unit should
provide an excellent foundation for beginning your study of Dante’s
work, and will certainly be useful as you look at the more complicated
themes later in the course. *

    sections: VII, 1-7; XII, 1-17; XXIV, 1-11.   
        
     Note on the text: In *Vita Nuova*, Dante used a combination of
    prose and verse style to create a series of poems on courtly love. 
    Published early in Dante’s career, the text is notable for its use
    of Italian and Tuscan dialects rather than the Latin language, which
    was far more traditional at the time.  The sonnets and ballads are
    thematically united by tales of Dante’s interaction with Beatrice,
    which move from his first vision of her to his reaction after her
    death.

    following sections: I, ii, 1-8; I, xix, 1-3; II, ii, 1-10.  As you
    read, please pay attention to Dante’s use of the vernacular as his
    preferred form of language.   
        
     Note on the text: In *De Vulgaria Eloquentia*, Dante distinguishes
    primary language (or the natural language) from secondary language
    (or the language used to study).  Although written in Latin, Dante
    extends his concept of language to say that Italian should be used
    in literature, and that Latin should be used only in works like
    essays.  This text is not only important for its revolutionary ideas
    about language, but because it is considered one of the earliest
    works of literary criticism.
