Many scholars consider Dante the ultimate Italian poet of his time.  He
introduced innovative stylistic techniques to the poetic tradition while
also drawing from the philosophy, history, and mythology of the ancient
world.  As we will see in the course, he composed his works in the
Italian vernacular, setting an important precedent in the literary world
of his time, when most of his contemporaries wrote only in Latin.  In
this course, we will consider Dante’s literature for its stylistic and
thematic contributions to the body of Medieval and Italian literature,
as well as for its inventive appraisal of Christianity. Before we look
at Dante’s specific literary works, we will first consider him as a
writer who worked in a particular historical context and will
accordingly begin by taking a look at Dante’s life as well as the
culture of Medieval Italy on a broader level.  We will then take a look
at some of Dante’s shorter works, most notably his early philosophical
treatises.  We will devote the majority of the course, however, to the
study of Dante’s masterpiece—*The Divine Comedy*.  While reading the
three works that comprise *The Divine Comedy* (*The Inferno*, *The
Purgatorio*, and *The Paradisio*), we will also take a look at several
of Dante’s more important shorter works, which established some of his
novel ideas about literature and language.  By the end of the course,
you will have a clear idea of Dante’s contributions to the literary
world, as well as some insight into his understandings of Christianity.
