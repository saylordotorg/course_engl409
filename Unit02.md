**Unit 2: The Inferno** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will start to work closely with Dante’s* The Divine
Comedy*.  The text consists of three books, known as* The Inferno*,* The
Purgatorio*, and* The Paradisio*, all of which were composed after his
exile.  Here, we will begin by studying the first section of his
three-part allegorical work, which depicts the poet-narrator’s journey
around Hell.  We will first examine the political and religious context
that inspired Dante’s thinly-veiled commentary on his world.  We will
also work through the text section by section in order to fully partake
in Dante’s creation of a world filled with flawed historical characters
as well as enrich our understanding of Dante’s often complicated
thematic implications.  *
