**Unit 3: Purgatorio** <span id="3"></span> 
*We will continue our critical study of Dante by looking at the second
section of* The Divine Comedy*, titled* The Purgatorio*.  In* The
Purgatorio*, Dante continues his trip through the afterlife with a
journey to the top of Mount Purgatory, led by the poet Virgil.  In this
unit, we will consider the representation of the seven “terraces” in a
specifically Christian context, which will enrich our reading of the
text.  In addition, we will look closely at the ways in which this
section of Dante’s work reflects the growing Medieval interest in
geography, science, and literature.  Perhaps most importantly, we will
monitor Dante’s evolving psychological concepts of sin. *
